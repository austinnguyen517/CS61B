Q: Can you think of an analogy between the process of tesselating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways? 
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?

A: The shape in which we design our hexagons is similar to that of rooms and hallways. The hexagon is a rectangle and the tesselation is chaining together pathways.

-----
Q: If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tesselating hexagons.

A: Just simply writing a new class for position. Then, figuring out offsets to make the hexagon themselves.

-----
Q: What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?

A: Their shapes. A room is typically square while a hallway is rectangle.

Q: For tesselating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way. 
After looking at your own implemention, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab. 
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?

A: It was quite different. I learned that there are much better ways around problems than simply taking them at face value.

-----
Q: Consider an algorithm for placing rooms and hallways on your map. 
Ideally, consider many algorithms and think about what makes some easier or harder to implement. Try and bring those ideas together into a single simple algorithm which accomplishes the task. 
In general, algorithms with as few edge cases as possible are better algorithms.

A: We can think of hallways and rooms as just rectangles. When a character is travelling, they must be travelling within the same designatd place type unless the space permits transitions.
